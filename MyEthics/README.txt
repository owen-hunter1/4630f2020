MyEthic README

=====================================================
Concept
======================================================
	MyEthic allows users to make more ethical purchases.
The two main features the app has to offer are product
logging and customizable ethic groups. An ethic group
is essentially a list of tags that relate to how the user
wants to make their purchase and those tags are referenced
to the list of products the user has purchased. These tags
are then used to calculate the users "ethic score" which
is a way for the user to track how ethical their purchases
are over time.

Build/Installation
======================================================
To install the app, place the apk in an accesible directory on your phone or
emulator. Run the .apk. Register with email and password (not stored in plaintext)
